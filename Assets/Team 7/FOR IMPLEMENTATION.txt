To implement this enemy you need to have a navmeshsurface on the ground.

The script SpawnEnemy needs to be modified to have an actual spawncondition
in the game, right now it is triggered by pressing E.

The script SpawnEnemy needs to be on the player or on something on the players
location to prevent the enemy from spawning too close to the player.

Make sure the Sheep have the Tag Sheep and are not Kinematic

In the Enemey AI I have made a space where you can implement the sheep dying if
the sheep team made a method for this or replacing the sheep with a dead one.
Its marked IMP01 so you can find it with cntrl F

In the Enemey AI I have made a space where you can implement the sheeps AI
getting disabled when its grabbed. Its marked IMP02 so you can find it with
cntrl F

If all of this is done When the conditions you have made to make a Drekavac spawn
are met the enemy should spawn and act as Expected.
