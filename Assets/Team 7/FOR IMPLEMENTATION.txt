To implement this enemy you need to have a navmeshsurface on the ground.

The script SpawnEnemy needs to be modified to have an actual spawncondition in the game, right now it is triggered by pressing E.

The script SpawnEnemy needs to be on the player or on something on the players location to prevent the enemy from spawning too close to the player.

Make sure the Sheep have the Tag Sheep and are not Kinematic

In the Enemey AI I have made a space where you can implement the sheep dying if the sheep team made a method for this or replacing the sheep with a dead one. Its marked IMP01 so you can find it with cntrl F

In the Enemey AI I have made a space where you can implement the sheeps AI getting disabled when its grabbed. Its marked IMP02 so you can find it with cntrl F

If all of this is done When the conditions you have made to make a Drekavac spawn are met the enemy should spawn and act as Expected.

If it is not please contact Lars (larsdecooleman) on Discord for any help

1. The new enemy uses a navmesh agent, just like the first one, and currently requires the player to have the "player" tag(This will be changed in the future)
2. The script SpawnEnemy currently spawns our first enemy(Drekavac) with the "E" key and the Second enemy(Phantom) with the "R" key.
3. I don't know if the player team has made a health system yet, but if they have you can add a call for dealing damage at line 50 of the PhantomProjectile script.
4. Expected behavior of the new enemy: 
If the player is looking in it's general direction, it will try to navigate to an area where the player is not looking. If it's not running to a new ambush spot,
and the player is not looking in it's direction, it will approach the player. Once it gets within shooting range, the enemy will start charging a shot and fire it at the player.
If the player at any point manages to continuously look at the phantom for a specific duration(all parameters are specified in the PhantomStats scriptableObject) it will lose one health. If it runs out of health it will be destroyed,
if it has health left after taking damage it will teleport to a random location and repeat it's behavior.

If it's not behaving as described above, or you got any other questions, feel free to contact us.
