Level 2:

Implemented player following mouse direction. 
Lots of problems:
-Not the whole map is walkable, within the maze for example. 
-Walls of maze do not have colliders.
-Scaling is off
-Snowfall particles are human-sized
-TerrainGroup_0 script is missing
-Memory leaks

Checked on team 4 branch, issues exist there too, so these are not merging issues.

Level 1:

Implemented:
-Fog of war
-Snowfall (also made it global to make it look better)
-Dog
-Shaman as much as possible

Issues:
-Sheep no longer moving, not sure why. 
-Fallen trees have no colliders
-With Team 1's camera changep, TriggerThing is no longer working like it's supposed to
