Hello there!
Not sure how I should list everything so bare with me ^^

All the scripts that are related to the AI enemy are in the prefab ''Scarecrow'' in the Prefabs folder.
Stuff to take into consideration: 
The "Detect Sheep" script uses a tag "sheep".
"New In Camera Detect" cs uses the players FOV camera (thats how we made it work for testing purposes)
"Look at Player" cs only requires for you to put the players model in the player reference.
"Monster 1AI" is controls the states of the monster. The animator is in the AI model. 
I think that kinda covers it for now. If I missed something please let us know (I am fairly new at making README files so it's probably quite chaotic) 

Toodles, see you on Thursday.
