# Scripts

In order to avoid conflicts we have changed your `Player` script in `PlayerWallet` and put it inside a prefab.
That prefab is then referenced by the player so you can work without changing other teams' work.

For further clarifications please contact @Samuele from integration team (and Tech lead)
