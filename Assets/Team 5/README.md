*That's your team folder! Here you can work freely with your team.*

### Scene
The scene that should be used can be found in Team 5 -> Scenes -> Level3Concepting.

<!-- Floors and backwalls all have correct collisions, there are no walls coming from the players camera angle. Updated floors and walls are in the works.

Warning: there were issues with scaling in 3d programs and now everything in unity is scaled up at least 50 times.<br>
&emsp;&emsp; This will NOT be final, but lack of time causes me to make this the only option, will be fixed in future.

Temporary enemy#2 spawnpoints and walltraps are grayboxed and visible in hierarchy.

There are some InsideOutsideTriggers grayboxed around. these areas would be entrances/exits from the cave system, increasing/decreasing length of view (when going inside decrease and when going outside increase), changing sound effects and visual effects (falling snow for example). -->


### Hierarchy
The hierarchy consists of every 3D model used in the scene, as well as some empty objects to be used as parent for the instantiated objects upon loading the scene, as done by the LevelManager script. There's also a parent object containing potential spawnpoints and a SpawnTrigger object, which is the physical trigger as well as the script to trigger the enemy spawns.

### Gameplay
The level is currently playable. The CameraFollowing script is temporary to make the level function, and the positioning of this camera will be adjusted in the future once everything is properly integrated.

The "peak scare" is located at the end of the level (top right). To trigger the scare, you must first enter the circular area and then exit it the same way. When exiting, enemies will spawn around you and the "chase" will begin. During the chase, enemies will block certain paths and force the player down a specific route. Currently, the chase doesnâ€™t lead anywhere meaningfully, as this is just a proof of concept.

The most efficient route to the end of the level can be seen in the image below.

Here the green dot is the player spawn, the blue line the trigger and the red line the route.

### Notes for integration team
- If needed: The LevelManager in the hierarchy needs to contain prefabs for the player, dog, sheep, enemy1 and enemy2. In case these aren't in the scene yet (they should be), they need to be added manually.
- Same goes for the transforms for the parent objects. These can just be dragged from the hierarchy, if needed.

- The SpawnTrigger objects in the hierarchy need to contain a list of all the spawnpoints. The "OnSpawnTriggered" event should also be linked to a function. This should already be in place, but it's put here in case it isn't.

- If possible: Correct the scales of the Drekavac and the sheep. They seem way smaller then intended.
- If possible: Correct the Drekavac behaviar, they spawn and recognize the navmesh correctly but don't seem to recognize the player in our level. If something from us is needed for this, just let us know.
- Aside from this, if it's already in that state, the level could be connected to the village.

### Other things
- The dog doesn't actually follow the player yet, this too will be fixed in the future.
