## Map
The scarecrow enemy can be placed on 1 of the points on the map and can teleport to all the ScarecrowPlacement points
Entry and exit are just for clarification
ShamanPlacement can just be done at the box

# The Relics and doors
The relics that are placed around the maze are for opening the doors, when collecting a relic the coresponding door opens.
The relics and doors should work on their own.

# Integration
The main thing needed is to add the enemy and the shaman.
Also the player is not integrated right and the camera should be fixed.
Sheep and dog should also be added.
