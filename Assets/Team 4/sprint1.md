# Sprint 1

## Map
Location: Assets/Map/Level2.unity
Player can be placed at placeholder.
Enemy still needs to be placed somewhere.

## Falling trap
Script: Scripts/FallingTrap.CS
Is already placed on a plane in the map. Currently checks if collision is with sheep by checking the gameObject name on line 24. This can be changed to how sheeps really work.
