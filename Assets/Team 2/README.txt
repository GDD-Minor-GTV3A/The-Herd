Welcome!
To make sheep work all you have to do is 
- make a herd controller game object and attach "HerdController" script to it, give the half-extents something like x = 8, y = 8 and attach a player transform
- make a NavMesh surface on the area where you need the sheep to walk
- place sheep prefabs and test if they follow player
- please make a tag "Sheep" and place it on sheep prefab (enemy 1 team requested that)
