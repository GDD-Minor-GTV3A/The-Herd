=== intro ===
The wind bites cold as you guide your flock down the mountain path. #layout:narrator

In the distance, a small village flickers with lantern light. #layout:narrator

A man steps forward, his face shadowed. #layout:narrator

"Shepherd… not many come this way anymore." #speaker:Villager #layout:left

* [Stay silent]
    ... #speaker:Player #layout:right
* [Ask about the village]
    "Do you welcome travelers here?" #speaker:Player #layout:right
    
    "We welcome the living, if they can remain so…" #speaker:Villager #layout:left
-
The sheep bleat, restless, and your dog growls at the darkness beyond the fields. #layout:narrator

"Whatever you do, Shepherd… keep your flock close. Whistles in the dark carry more than wind." #speaker:Villager #layout:left

* [Nod and move on]
    You press on, the road narrowing into shadow. #speaker:Player #layout:right
* [Stay and ask more]
    "What do you mean by whistles?" #speaker:Player #layout:right
    
    The villager looks away, lantern light trembling. #layout:narrator
    
    "Best you not find out." #speaker:Villager #layout:left
